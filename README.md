# Cosm Usage Cost Tracker
This webapp is designed to track resource usage costs, based on a [Cosm](http://cosm.com) datastream.
It will take usage data of a certain resource, such as electricity, from a Cosm datastream, and compute it's daily usage and the cost, based on a fixed price per usage unit.

It is supposed to grow into a full Cosm App some time in the future, but right now, you can just set it up on your own webserver.

There is a demo up on http://cosm.tiefpunkt.com/usagecost/. It is based on the "Strom_Gesamtverbrauch" datastream from the [RaumZeitLabor Cosm Feed](http://cosm.com/feeds/42055), which measures total electricity usage of the [RaumZeitLabor](http://raumzeitlabor.de/), a hackerspace in Mannheim, Germany.
